## Plan

### Step 1

1. Get an idea to work on. Plan what I want the app to have in terms of Wireframe, data, API and functionalities.

2. Create the project files locally: erb files, database and which APIs are feasible at this stage.

3. Deploy to Heroku, to be certain that that the basics work and so that I can build from there.

### Step 2 - Make it work

1. Start with the homepage and the login logic. There will be three levels of access:
   i. The guest
   ii. The registered user
   iii. The admin

2. Start with the pages flow logic

### Step 3 - Make it better

1. Add APIs

### Step 4 - Make it nice
