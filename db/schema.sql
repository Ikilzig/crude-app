Its founder, the self-named CryptoQueen, Ruja Ignatova, hosted glitzy events across the world, including one in the U.K. Wembley Arena. There, she touted OneCoin as a Bitcoin Killer. Millions of investors would later end up defrauded in what turned out to be a $4 billion Ponzi scheme that used money from new investors to pay returns to the existing ones. Ignatova disappeared in 2017 when the net was finally closing in and police had filed a warrant for her arrest.

People were so excited about it that they purchased DAO tokens by the truckload. The DAO token sale quickly made this project the largest crowdfund in history, bringing in over $168 million USD. This success translated into market activity once the coin got listed on exchanges. At its peak, according to CoinGecko, the DAO token reached a price of 0.19 USD. On June 18, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO smart contract, resulting in a loss exceeding $50 million USD. Once news of the attack circulated, traders dumped the DAO token, sending its price spiraling downwards. Source: https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-failures-all-time/ ');
